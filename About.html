        Hello. My name is Aishah. Along with my day job as an engineer, I am a
        freelance/hobbyist photographer. My journey in photography took its
        first major turn when I took a course in photography in 2011, which is
        also when I did my first photoshoot. I have always loved the rich
        artistic culture of Kuwait, where I was born, and relish the ability to
        capture it in my photography. My interests and specialty include
        capturing the picturesque natural environment, architectural marvels,
        and the cuisine of my beloved homeland. Along with photography, I also
        provide photo editing and graphic design services. Please feel free to
        contact me for creative and unique works of art.
